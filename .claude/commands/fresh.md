description: Clone a fresh version of the repo from main to work apart from other claude instances
---

Clone the agility-metronome repository into a fresh directory in /workspaces with a timestamp suffix (e.g., agility-metronome-20251014-031907). After cloning, inform the user of the new directory path so they can navigate to it.

Steps:
1. Generate a timestamp-based directory name
2. Clone from https://github.com/darrillaga/agility-metronome.git
3. Report the new directory path to the user
